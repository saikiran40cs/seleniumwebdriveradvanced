# 3. TestNG

TestNG is a testing framework inspired from JUnit and NUnit but introducing some new functionalities that make it more powerful and easier to use, such as:

* Annotations.
* Run your tests in arbitrarily big thread pools with various policies available \(all methods in their own thread, one thread per test class, etc...\).
* Test that your code is multithread safe.
* Flexible test configuration.
* Support for data-driven testing \(with @DataProvider\).
* Support for parameters.
* Powerful execution model \(no more TestSuite\).
* Supported by a variety of tools and plug-ins \(Eclipse, IDEA, Maven, etc...\).
* Embeds BeanShell for further flexibility.
* Default JDK functions for runtime and logging \(no dependencies\).
* Dependent methods for application server testing.
